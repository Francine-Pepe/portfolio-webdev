                I love to create stuff, and that is why I first worked as a Fashion Designer for almost 10 years. After moving to Germany, I felt like changing my career as well, but I still wanted to continue working creatively, so, here I am creating beautiful and functional Websites and Apps.
                I am passionate about visual design and animation, which I think I express myself in the most effective and clean way.
